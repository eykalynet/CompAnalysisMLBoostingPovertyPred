# CompAnalysisMLBoostingPovertyPred
This repository contains a basic machine learning project I worked on during my free time. The goal of the study was to predict and classify household wealth quintiles in the Philippines. 

The project explores:
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Computational efficiency: training/testing time and model size using `time` and `memory_profiler`.

The analysis was conducted to understand how different models handle this classification task in terms of both performance and efficiency.
